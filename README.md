# Twitter - Sentiment Analysis with Emojis

## Project Description
This project focuses on **sentiment analysis** using emojis to classify the emotional tone of tweets. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project analyzes how emojis are used in tweets and their relationship with sentiment.

### Project Workflow
1. **Importing Libraries and Loading Data:**
   - Libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` are imported.
   - A dataset of tweets, including the tweet text and associated emojis, is loaded.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaning and normalizing the tweet texts.
   - Extracting emojis and analyzing their frequency in the text.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualizing the distribution of emojis in tweets.
   - Grouping tweets by accounts to show the number of tweets per account.
   - Analyzing correlations between popular accounts and their emoji usage.

4. **Sentiment Modeling:**
   - Using NLP techniques to classify tweets into different sentiment categories.
   - Applying algorithms to predict sentiment based on the presence of emojis.

5. **Results Visualization:**
   - Generating graphs and tables that illustrate:
     - The relationship between emojis used and the sentiment detected.
     - Emoji usage frequency by the most popular accounts.

## Libraries Used
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations.
- **re (Regex)**: For text cleaning and emoji extraction.
- **nltk**: For natural language processing.

## Key Features
- **Emoji Sentiment Analysis:** Leveraging emojis as indicators of sentiment in tweets.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Visualizing trends in emoji usage and their sentiment implications.
- **NLP Integration:** Combining traditional NLP techniques with emoji-specific sentiment modeling.

## System Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- Additional dependencies installed via `pip`.
